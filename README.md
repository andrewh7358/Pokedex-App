# Pokédex

This is a code demo I made of a simple Pokédex showcasing TypeScript and React.

This project uses [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/). PokéAPI is an open-source RESTful API detailing everything about the Pokémon main game series.

This Pokédex allows you to see details of the Pokémon from the first generation of the series. The details includes an in-game sprite, their type, their height, their weight, and an in-game description. You can filter the list of Pokémon by name. You can also go to a specific Pokédex entry by its number.

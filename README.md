# Pokédex

This is a simple Pokédex I made in TypeScript and React.

This Pokédex allows you to see details of the Pokémon from the first region of the series. By selecting a Pokémon, you view one of their in-game sprites and some basic information about them. You can filter the list of Pokémon by name and can also go to a Pokédex entry by its Pokédex number.

This project uses [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/). PokéAPI is an open-source RESTful API detailing everything about the Pokémon main game series.
